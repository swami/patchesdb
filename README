Resonance Instrument Database (PatchesDB deployment site)
http://sounds.resonance.org

PatchesDB is a web based instrument database system used for distributing
and sharing instrument files.  The source code is distributed under the
GPL v2 license.

It is currently work in progress and really rough around the edges.
If you are really interested in installing your own instance of this
software, please contact the author or join the swami-devel mailing list.

The main reason for the current release is to solicit support from other
developers and users interested in contributing.  We encourage anyone
interested to contact us.
